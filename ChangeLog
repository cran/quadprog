	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.5-8

	* DESCRIPTION (Author): Added Cleve Moler as requested per CRAN
	policy 

	* src/solve.QP.compact.f, solve.QP.f: Implemented fixes suggested
	at:
	https://chasethedevil.github.io/post/quadprog-nans/
	https://github.com/cran/quadprog/pull/1/files

2019-05-05 Berwin A Turlach  <Berwin.Turlach@gmail.com>

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.5-7

	* src/Makevars, src/Makevars.win: Changed compiler flags so that
	the package should work with older versions of R (<3.6.0) again.

2013-04-17  Berwin A Turlach  <Berwin.Turlach@gmail.com>

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.5-5

	* src/util.f: Changed declaration of arrays in subroutine to avoid
	faults if R is running with array bound checks.

2011-05-12  Berwin A Turlach  <Berwin.Turlach@gmail.com>

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.5-4.

	* R/quadprog.R, DESCRIPTION, src/aind.f, src/solve.QP.compact.f:
	src/init.c, src/quadprog.h, src/solve.QP.f: Updated e-mail
	details. 

2010-04-09  Berwin A Turlach  <berwin@maths.uwa.edu.au>

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.5-3.

	* tests/: added further test problems.
	
	* src/aind.f: changed argument ok from LOGICAL to INTEGER as per
	documentation on how logicals should be passed to FORTRAN code.

	* NAMESPACE: added .registration and .fixes argument to useDynLib
	directive. 
	
	* R/quadprog.R: removed PACKAGE argument from FF calls and used
	registered symbols in namespace instead.

2010-04-08  Berwin A Turlach  <berwin@maths.uwa.edu.au>

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.5-2.

	* src/init.c, src/quadprog.h, src/quadprog-win.def, src/Makevars:
	Implemented changes to register native routines and control
	visibility.  At least one other package seems to call the FORTRAN
	code directly and checks of that package fail more gracefully if
	the interface to a registered FORTRAN routine changes.

2010-04-06  Berwin A Turlach  <berwin@maths.uwa.edu.au>

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.5-1.

	* src/solve.QP.f, src/solve.QP.compact.f, man/solve.QP.Rd,
	man/solve.QP.compact.Rd, R/quadprog.R: Implemented changes
	proposed by Jason Nielsen <jdn@cs.sfu.ca> to return the
	Lagrangian. 

	* src/solve.QP.f, src/solve.QP.compact.f: Added some code to
	calculate a number close to machine precision.  If inequality
	constraints are fulfilled to this precision, they are considered
	fulfilled.  This solves some numerical problems reported in the
	past (see TalbotKatz.R in /tests)

	* tests/: added a directory with tests.

	* DESCRIPTION: Took over maintenance from Kurt Hornink.  New
	version is 1.5-0.  Added Type: entry, change license to GPL
	(>=2).

	* src/Makevars, src/Makevars.win: latter new, both ensure that the
	solve.QP*.f files are compiled with SAFE_FFLAGS which seems to be
	necessary for some platforms.

	* LICENSE.GPL-2, LICENSE.GPL-3: GPL license files to accompany
	source but not to be installed.

	* src/solve.QP.f, src/solve.QP.compact.f: Fixed typo in line after
	loop 191.  Noticed by Phillip Wild <p.wild@uq.edu.au> while
	porting the code to JAVA.
